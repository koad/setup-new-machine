# 🚀 koad's new machine setup

A personal script for setting up new machines with my preferred tools and configs.

## What is this?

This repo contains a `command.sh` file for me personally to setup new machines. It uses [koad:io](https://github.com/koad/io) and installs [alice](https://github.com/koad/alice) who knows what I like.

Don't copy this shit bit for bit, use it as an example and build your own preference based thingymajiggy.

## 🔧 One-Command Installation

Run this right from bash using curl:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koad/new-machine-setup/main/command.sh | bash
```

## 📋 What It Does

1. Installs [koad:io](https://github.com/koad/io) - my personal toolset
2. Configures your PATH to include koad:io's bin directory
3. Sets up [alice](https://github.com/koad/alice) - my stateless context agent
4. Installs essential packages and the starship prompt

Check out [koad:io](https://github.com/koad/io) and [alice](https://github.com/koad/alice)'s repos to see what is actually going on here.

## 🤖 About Alice

Alice is my stateless context agent. She's fun to play with and chase rabbits with, but she's not meant to be anything serious. She knows my preferences and can install/configure tools the way I like them.
